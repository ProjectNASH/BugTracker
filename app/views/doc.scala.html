	<font size=4 face="Helvetica">BugTracker is a simple web application aimed at teams to post and solve bugs that they encounter during their development cycle. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system. The main benefit of a bug-tracking system is to provide a clear centralized overview of development requests. In a corporate environment, a bug-tracking system may be used to generate reports on the productivity of programmers at fixing bugs.</font>

	<font face="Helvetica"><h1><u>How does BugTracker work?</u></h1></font>
	<font size=4 face="Helvetica">BugTracker was developed keeping simplicity in mind. 
		<ol>
			<li><u><b>Setup BugTracker</b></u></li><br>
			<font size=3 face="Helvetica">
				<p>On server-side, few of the things that needs to setup are- </p>

				<ul>
					<li>DBMS-MySQL</li>
					<li>Scala-sbt</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>It is important that whoever is setting up the application should have some knowledge of Scala and Play Framework.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Download BugTracker</li>
					<li>Create a database in MySQL called <i>"bugtracker"</i>.</li>
					<li>Open up CMD and go to <i>"../play-samples-play-scala-starter-example</i>"</li>
					<li>Start the application (usually <i>"sbt run"</i>)</li>
					<li>Open your web-browser and visit <i>"localhost:3000" (You can also setup this up in your backend-server, this documentation is for demonstration purpose)</i></li>
					<li>Click Setup</li>
					<li>Follow as per the instructions provided</li>
					
				</ol>
				<p><b>NOTE:</b> You could face some delay in the setup  because one stage in the process is the "Email Notification Sytem", where email-notifications are sent to the users of the application, notifying them that their account has been set up on BugTracker.</p>
			</font>
			<br>
			<li><u><b>Posting bugs/Answering them</b></u></li>
			<font size=3 face="Helvetica">
			<p>Posting and answering bugs is simple. After logging in, you can see "Post Quesries" or "View Queries" where you can report a bug or answer the queries of your team-mates.</p>
